Hello <%= @initiator.name %>,

We finished running your tests and everything looks good. You can find your report: <%= report_url(@report) %>

Here are the individual results:
<% @report.results.order('id ASC').each do |test| %>

- <%= test.test_case.title %>: <%= test.status %> <% if test.status == 'Passed' %>(executed in <%= (test.ended_at - test.started_at).round(2) %> seconds)<% end %> 
<% end %> 


Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help out with anything else.


Thanks,

Mark & Zack
