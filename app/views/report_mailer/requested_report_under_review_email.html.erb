<p>Hello,</p>

<p>We just finished running your tests and ran into some issues that we are looking into and will report back to you ASAP. You can look over the initial report here: <%= link_to report_url(@report), report_url(@report) %></p>

<p>And here is a quick overview:</p>
<ul>
<% @report.results.order('id ASC').each do |test| %>
<li><%= test.test_case.title %>: <%= test.status %> <% if test.status == 'Passed' %>(executed in <%= (test.ended_at - test.started_at).round(2) %> seconds)<% end %></li>
<% end %> 
</ul>
<br/>
<p>Hopefully this is just a false negative, but like we said, we are looking into what happened and will get back to you ASAP. </p>

<p>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Mark &amp; Zack<br/>
