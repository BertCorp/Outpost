Good morning!

We just successfully finished running your tests for the day and everything looks good! If you'd like to view the full report, you can do so here: <%= report_url(@report) %> 

Here are the individual results:
<% @report.results.order('id ASC').each do |test| %>

- <%= test.test_case.title %>: <%= test.status %> <% if test.status == 'Passed' %>(executed in <%= (test.ended_at - test.started_at).round(2) %> seconds)<% end %> 
<% end %> 


If you have any questions please don't hesitate to drop us a note!

Thanks,

Mark & Zack
