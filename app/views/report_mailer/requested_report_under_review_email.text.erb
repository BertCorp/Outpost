Hello,

We just finished running your tests and ran into some issues that we are looking into and will report back to you ASAP. You can look over the initial report here: <%= report_url(@report) %>

And here is a quick overview:
<% @report.results.order('id ASC').each do |test| %>

- <%= test.test_case.title %>: <%= test.status %> <% if test.status == 'Passed' %>(executed in <%= (test.ended_at - test.started_at).round(2) %> seconds)<% end %>
<% end %> 


Hopefully this is just a false negative, but like we said, we are looking into what happened and will get back to you ASAP. 

Thanks,

Mark & Zack
