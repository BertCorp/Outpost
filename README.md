Coming soon.

To Do:

- Build out scaffolding for managing users &amp; companies.
- Companies individual view pages should essentially be like viewing their dashboard (but with extra powers probably).
- User dashboards should list current tests in company's test suite with current status. Should also be able to view results of running tests/reports.
- User/Company should be able to manage their stripe credit card info from their dashboard.

Done: 

- Edit my (current user's) account info
- Scope Reports Index to user or all if is_admin?
- Ability for Mark/Zack to come in and start running tests and update status.
- Big old "run tests" button for users that pings Mark + Zack.
